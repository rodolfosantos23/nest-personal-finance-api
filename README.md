## Description  

A personal finance API project made with NEST.js to apply some concepts of Software Engineering 
and Design Patterns.

The goal is to make an API with the following resources:

- User registration
- Bank account registration
- Spending and earnings
- Bill administration
- Credit Card monthly spendings
- Personal finance balance

Some of the concepts that I'll going to apply:

- SOLID principles
- Clean Code
- DDD 
- In Memory Database
- Unity and End to End tests


This repository is for studies purposes, the concepts and de code structure will change often ðŸ˜‚
